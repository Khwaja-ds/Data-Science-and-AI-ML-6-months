🚢Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal of this project is to deeply understand the dataset, identify important patterns, handle missing values and outliers, and prepare the data for predictive modeling.

📁 Files Used
train.csv: Main dataset with features and the target variable (Survived)

test.csv: Dataset without the Survived column (for prediction)

gender_submission.csv: Sample submission format for Kaggle

📊 EDA Techniques Covered
🔍 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
Shape of data, basic structure using .info() and .describe()

Data types and column-wise null value analysis

🧼 2. Data Cleaning
Checked and handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)

Dropped non-informative or high-null columns (Cabin, Ticket)

🧠 3. Feature Engineering
Extracted Title from Name (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)

Created new binary features (Is_Alone, Family_Size)

Converted categorical features to numerical (Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding)

📈 4. Univariate Analysis
Distribution of Age, Fare, and Survived

Countplots for Sex, Pclass, Embarked

📉 5. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
Survival comparison across different groups (Sex, Pclass, Embarked)

Boxplots and barplots to understand correlations

📦 6. Outlier Detection & Treatment
Detected outliers in Fare and Age using boxplots

Explained how to handle outliers using IQR or transformation

🔗 7. Correlation Analysis
Generated and visualized a correlation heatmap

Identified highly correlated features with Survived

🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)

📌 Key Insights
Females had a significantly higher survival rate.

Passengers from Pclass 1 were more likely to survive.

Passengers traveling alone were less likely to survive.

Age and Fare had a wide range and needed treatment for outliers.

💡 Future Scope
Build machine learning models for survival prediction (RandomForest, SVM, etc.)

Tune models using GridSearchCV and cross-validation

Deploy as a web application using Streamlit or Flask
