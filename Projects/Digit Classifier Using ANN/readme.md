## ðŸ“Š How I Built the ANN Model  

I built this project using a simple **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** instead of a CNN.  
Hereâ€™s the step-by-step explanation of how the model was created:  

### 1. Dataset  
- The **MNIST dataset** was used, which contains **70,000 images of handwritten digits (0â€“9)**.  
- Each image is **28x28 pixels** in grayscale.  
- The dataset is split into:
  - 60,000 images for training  
  - 10,000 images for testing  

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- **Normalization**: Pixel values (0â€“255) were scaled down to the range **0â€“1** for faster training.  
- **Flattening**: Each 28x28 image was reshaped into a **1D vector of size 784** so it could be passed into a fully connected neural network.  
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Labels (0â€“9) were converted into categorical format, e.g., digit "3" â†’ `[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]`.  

### 3. ANN Architecture  
The model was built using **Keras Sequential API** with the following layers:  

- **Input Layer**: 784 neurons (one for each pixel).  
- **Hidden Layer 1**: 128 neurons, ReLU activation.  
- **Hidden Layer 2**: 64 neurons, ReLU activation.  
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons (for digits 0â€“9), Softmax activation.  

ðŸ‘‰ ReLU was chosen for hidden layers because it helps avoid the vanishing gradient problem and speeds up training.  
ðŸ‘‰ Softmax was chosen in the output layer to give a probability distribution across all 10 digit classes.  

### 4. Training  
- **Optimizer**: Adam (efficient gradient descent optimization).  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy (suitable for multi-class classification).  
- **Metrics**: Accuracy was used to evaluate performance.  
- **Epochs**: Trained for 10 iterations over the dataset with a batch size of 32.  

### 5. Saving the Model  
- After training, the model was saved in HDF5 format (`mnist_ann.h5`).  
- This allows the model to be loaded later in the Streamlit frontend for predictions.

## ðŸŽ¨ How I Built the Frontend  

The frontend was built using **Streamlit**, which makes it easy to deploy ML models with interactive UI.  

### 1. Input Options  
The app provides two ways to input a digit:  
- **Upload an Image**: Users can upload a pre-drawn digit image (28x28 grayscale).  
- **Draw a Digit**: Users can directly draw a digit on a canvas using the `streamlit-drawable-canvas` library.  

### 2. Preprocessing in Frontend  
- If an image is uploaded, it is resized to 28x28 and converted to grayscale.  
- If a digit is drawn, the canvas result is converted into a grayscale PIL image.  
- The processed image is then normalized (0â€“1), flattened into a vector of 784 values, and reshaped into the format required by the ANN.  

### 3. Prediction Workflow  
- The preprocessed image is passed to the loaded model (`mnist_ann.h5`).  
- The model outputs probabilities for each digit class (0â€“9).  
- The digit with the highest probability is selected as the **prediction**.  
- The app also shows the **confidence score (%)** of the prediction.  

### 4. UI/UX Features  
- A **radio button** lets users choose between Upload and Draw modes.  
- The predicted digit and confidence score are displayed dynamically.  
- Simple and clean layout designed with `st.set_page_config()` for better user experience.

## âœ… Summary  
- The **ANN model** was built from scratch using only fully connected layers.  
- The model was trained on MNIST and saved as `mnist_ann.h5`.  
- The **frontend** was created with Streamlit, supporting both image uploads and digit drawing.  
- Users get real-time predictions with confidence scores in an interactive UI.
